# Rescue Animal Tracker
#### This was a Java project we had to complete in my Intro to Application Development course at SNHU IT-145.
#### I used Java in VS Code as I really don't like Eclipse but this will work if you import it into eclipse.
#### to run it setup your Java in enviorment in VS Code. From the command prompt use javac *.java then run  
#### java Driver.java to start the program in your command prompt.
